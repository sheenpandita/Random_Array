# Random_Array
"  create a random array (with values from 0 to 1) of size (20x3),   Split the array into two equal arrays 'M' and 'N', each of size (10x3),   Let the instances (rows) in array 'M' be named alphabetically from 'A' to 'J' and instances in array 'N' be named alphabetically from 'Q' to 'Z',     Calculate the pairwise distance between elements of array 'M' and array 'N'. For example, the distance between the instances A and Q can be calculated as sqrt((A1-Q1)^2+(A2-Q2)^2)),    Calculate the distance in following order, [d(A,Q), d(A,R), d(A,S),..., d(B,Q), d(B,R), ...],      Filter out the list of pairs with distance &lt; 0.5,
